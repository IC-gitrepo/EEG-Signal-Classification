# EEG-Signal-Classification
Action &amp; Thought Recognition from EEG Signals. The goal is to train Machine Learning Classifiers, to distinguish between 4 kinds of EEG signals- 2 of which are actual muscle movements (move fist, move feet) and 2 are imagined movements or motor imagery (imagine moving fist, imagine moving feet).
